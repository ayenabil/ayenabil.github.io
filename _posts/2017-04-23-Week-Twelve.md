What did you do this past week?

My partners and I completed IDB3 this past week. It has been a very project and I have learned a lot about web development the past two months. We have also done research on loggers to prepare for the lecture about them this week.

What's in your way?

There are a few more quizzes left I need to study for. The final exam is coming up in 2 weeks so I need to prepare myself for that as well. We have covered a wide range of topics so I will make sure to review all of them.

What will you do next week?

This next week is going to be spent studying for my upcoming final exams so that I will be fully prepared then.

This Class

We had our last lecture before the presentations start. We went more over Java, refactoring and other methods. I am excited to see the presentations of all the other groups this week.

Tip of the Week

FInal exams are coming up soon. It is better to start studying and reviewing the material right now so you wont feel stressed out later on.
