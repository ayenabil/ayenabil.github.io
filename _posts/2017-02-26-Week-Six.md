What did you do this past week?

This week has been pretty stressful. I have my Algorithms and Software Engineering exams coming up early this week so I spent the past week preparing for it. I spent a couple hours studying both subjects for the past week so I wont feel it pile up later on in the exam dates. 

What's in your way?

I will make sure I review the rest of Software Engineering. There are some concepts such as classes and closures that I need to spend some more time working on so I can be fully prepared.

What will you do next week?

I will spend next week relaxing and studying for technical interviews after my exams are over Tuesday. Its going to be a grace week with no major deadlines anytime soon so it will definitely be a time to catch up on lost sleep and friends!

This Class

We have been learning more about the inner workings on Python recently. We discussed concepts such as working with closures and decorators. We worked on how to implement the range function using iterators which was a neat application of iterators and building a function from scratch.

Tip of the Week

Take small walks outside whenever you have been studying a lot and need a break. Especially during midterm week, focusing on one subject for multiple hours at a time will be exhausting so its always a great idea to get up to clear your mind so when you get back to studying, you'll be back in your prime shape to focus.
