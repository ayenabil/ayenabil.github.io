What did you do this past week?

Most of this week was spent working on the second phase of IDB. This part was more challenging for backend as this time we need to make sure models.py and the unit tests work as well as getting the main app to start working. Getting my local database to start working properly was a challenge at first since I have been getting some unknown errors but eventually found a way to fix them. Eventually, we finished most of it and have a bit left to work on later this week.

What's in your way?

The rest of IDB2 needs to be completed this week. There is some work left to be done such as updating Apiary and making sure the unit tests work properly.

What will you do next week?

Next week will be spent finishing IDB2 and keeping up with the current material as we shifted from python to SQL right now.

This Class

This week we have learned different SQL methods. It seemed a bit confusing at first but made much more sense as time progressed. It is interesting to see the variety of ways to manipulate and sort a set of data.

Tip of the Week

The list of courses available is going to be released soon so be prepared to figure out which classes to enroll in now and possible backup classes so it won't be stressful once it is time for you to reigster.
