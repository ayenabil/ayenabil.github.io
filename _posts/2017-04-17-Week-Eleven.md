What did you do this past week?

This past week was spent working on IDB3. It seems like we have finished most of the difficult part in IDB2 since phase 3 so far seems more straightforward. For the backend, my partner and I met up and implemented most of the 'search' features. There is still some more work left to be done until we finish it. 

What's in your way?

So far IDB3 is currently in the way, but currently all that is left is finishing the search feature, finding a way to incorporate another group's API and then building the presentation. I have an Algorithms exam coming up this Monday so once I finish that, I will have a lot more free time in the coming week.

What will you do next week?

Next week will be spent mostly on IDB3. There is curretly no major obstacles in the way so i am confident we will be able to finish it soon without any major setbacks.

This Class

This week was spent learning more about Java and refactoring. We looked at more files related to 'Store.java' where each file had a more cleaner and easier to read format of implementing a rental store.

Tip of the Week

Sometimes the best way to learn something is to teach it others as it helps solidify your understanding of the material the more you explain it.
