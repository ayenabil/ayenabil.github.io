What did you do this past week?

This week was spent working on IDB1 with my group. It was interesting getting a feel of how it is like working with a group on a big scale project such as this that will continue into more parts in the next several weeks. I was working on the backend, and currently the main confusing part was not being sure if the models were implemented correctly since we did not have a way of testing them yet until we use create the database in the later phases.

What's in your way?

Currently most of my work was completed the past week so until learning more about IDB2, time will be spent relaxing and focusing on my other classes.

What will you do next week?

Next week will be spent working on the second phase of the IDB project. For backend, Ill will most likely create the databases in a server. I enjoyed working on the first phase and am definitely looking forward to working on this phase too.

This Class

This week was spent learning various join techniques such as ThetaJoin or NaturalJoin. It was interesting learning about ways to compare and combine two sets of information.

Tip of the Week

Always check Piazza and never be afraid to post questions for things you dont know. There is a high chance another student or instructor out there will see your question and have a quick way of responding to you.
