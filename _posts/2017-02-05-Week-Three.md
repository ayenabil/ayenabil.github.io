title: Week Three

What did you do this past week?

This week has been mostly spent on working on Collatz. It took some time getting used to at first such as figuring out how to implement the right cache correctly. Trying out different methods that seemed efficient at first but ended up being too slow for SPOJ was initially frustrating but in the end I managed to implement an optimal solution. It felt very satisfying to see SPOJ accept my solution after spending a long figuring out how to optimize my solution. I implemented a meta cache that already has the max cycle lengths of every 1000 thousand intervals and whatever numbers are left over in the interval, I add them into a lazy cache.

What's in your way?

I need to spend some time reviewing concepts for my Algorithms class and adjusting myself to proofs. Project 2 is coming up soon so I am getting more comfortable with Python and the software tools used for Collatz.

What will you do next week?

I finished updating my resume so I am going to spend my time applying for internships for the summer. Also, I will start the next project early once it is assigned.

This Class

There is a lot going on in the class at once from readings to projects to understanding new Python concepts, but it is spread in manageable chunks. Overall, I am getting a lot out of the class especially after working on Collatz. Trying to find new efficient implementations to the solution helped with my creativity and scope of programming which will be a useful skill to carry on later on.

Tip of the Week

CodeAcademy is a useful site that helpfuls you learn a variety of languages and scripting tools. There is a wide selection of beginners courses available such as Java, Python, SQL, Ruby on Rails, etc.
