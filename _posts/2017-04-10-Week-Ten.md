What did you do this past week?

This past week was spent finishing up IDB2. Most of it was finsihed the week before so this week was spent finishing up models.py and refining the test cases and technical report for the backend. The weekend afterwards was relaxing and I am pretty excited to work on IDB phase 3 coming up soon.

What's in your way?

IDB3 is coming up soon so I will need to be ready for that. I have an algorithms exam coming up next week so I will be spending some time working on that too.

What will you do next week?

Next week will be focused more on fully understanding SQL and now reviewing Java. Most of the review will be spent on mastering the syntax and such since I have been used to working with Python for a while.

This Class

This week we have spent learning more about SQL such as subqueries and more methods. We have transtitioned to java now as we are learning more about refactoring and the different ways we can write a piece of code so it makes more sense such as distributing one massive function into multiple small ones.

Tip of the Week

Going to the GDC labs for studying is always a great way of motivating yourself to work on your assignments or learn more about coding as many other people there are also working on the same thing.
