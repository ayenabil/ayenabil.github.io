What did you do this past week?

This was a pretty productive week. My partner and I started on working on the Netflix and almost completed it with an RMSE of 0.97. All that is left right now is some finihsing touches, making sure we followed all the directions. I am glad to get it done early because I ended up getting sick last night so it feels fairly relieving to not worry about an upcoming project in the meantime. 

What's in your way?

Career Fair is coming up this Tuesday. Hopefully I will get better by then so I can be at my best shape when I introduce myself to the recruiters there. New python concepts are getting introduced recently so I need to get used to that.

What will you do next week?

Next week will be spent looking over our Netflix project again to make sure it is fully ready. I have back to back Algorithms and Software Engineering exams two weeks from now so I will start studying soon for them. 

This Class

I have been starting to keep up with the pace of the class and it feels very rewarding. We have been learning more about the small details of python and it is interesting to see how specific a language can be.

Tip of the Week

CodingBat gives some nice programming puzzles in both Java and Python for beginners. It gives good practice for those who just started Python and would like to apply what they have learned.
