What did you do this past week?

This has been a laid back week. I met up with my partner this Wednesday to finish Netflix and make sure we had all the requirements ready. I have learned some more useful skills working on Netflix and I can't wait to see what else I will learn in the upcoming projects.

What's in your way?

I am having some trouble learning about the new topic in ALgorithms, dynamic programming. I have to set aside some time understanding it. Exams for this class and Algorithms is coming up so I need to work on that too.

What will you do next week?

Next week will be spent mostly on studying for both of my exams since they are only a day apart. I spent some time looking at previous lecture notes but I will do more as the week progresses.

This Class

This week was focused more on the applications of Software Engineering. We had a guest speaker from Bloomberg come speak to us about his work. His work revolves around making the search system more reliable and efficient for the company. 

Tip of the Week

Turning off your phone and putting it somewhere unreachable while studying helps eliminate distractions. Even during studying, the reflex of checking your phone to see some notification breaks your concentration. It is better to use it once as a break after a study session is over rather than multiple short times in the middle of a study session.
