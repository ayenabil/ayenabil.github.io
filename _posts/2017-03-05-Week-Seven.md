What did you do this past week?

The first half of this week was spent mostly on studying for my exams Monday and Tuesday. I felt that both my Algortihms and Software Engineering exam went fairly well but I'll see how it goes as the results come. I am glad I spent a lot of time learning about how python works for the exam.

What's in your way?

The third project is coming up, and I've heard from previous students that this is the main aspect of the class. I just found a team to join and I am pretty excited to see what is in store.

What will you do next week?

I will spend next week learning about using new software tools such as Angular and Flask so I won;t be lost for the upcoming project. I dont have Algortihms homework due this week so that is a huge weight off my shoulders.

This Class

Class this week has been spent on the exam and also learning about mobile development from another guest speaker this Thursday. It was interesting learning about how much a single application has to change every year to keep up with the current software and hardware.

Tip of the Week

For those who want to incorporate game development in Python, Pygame is a fun library to use for game development utilizing sprites and animations. It is relatively easy to learn and allows to create some deep and interesting projects.
