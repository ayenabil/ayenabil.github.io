What did you do this past week?

This past week was spent listening to the extra lectures of various Python libraries and also listening to half of the final group presentations.

What's in your way?

My final algortihms assignment is due in a couple of days and after that I will be done with all of my homework assignments and projects for the semester. All that is left is to prepare for final exams the next 2 weeks.

What will you do next week?

This next week will be spent preparing for the final Software Engineering exam this Thursday. I have a decent general grasp of all the concepts covered but I need to spend more time reviewing them.

This Class

As I approach the last week of this class, I am very satisfied with what I got out of it. I initially had a big learning curve to pass in the first few weeks getting used to Python and the new software tools, but after that was over, all the concepts and tools we used afterwards fell into place. Overall, I learned a lot in the course and am confident to be using the skills I acquired both in later classes and also while working.

Tip of the Week

Summer is coming up soon. Keep a proper schedule in what you will be planning to do then so you can make the most out of it.
